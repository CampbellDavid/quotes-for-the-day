It is not necessary to inquire whether a woman would like something for dessert. The answer is yes, she would like something for dessert, but she would like you to order it so she can pick at it with your fork. She does not want you to call attention to this by saying, 'If you wanted a dessert, why didn't you order one?' You must understand, she has the dessert she wants. The dessert she wants is contained within yours. -- Merrill Marcoe, "An Insider's Guide to the American Woman"
